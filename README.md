## 🎯 How to Use

1. **Open the application** in your web browser (http://localhost:5000)

2. **Paste a news article** into the text box
   - The longer the article, the more accurate the prediction

3. **Click "Check News"** button
   - Or press `Ctrl+Enter` (Cmd+Enter on Mac)

4. **View the result**
   - See if the news is predicted as **REAL** or **FAKE**
   - Check the confidence percentage (0-100%)
   - Green indicates real news, red indicates fake news

## 🧠 How It Works

### Model Details

- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF Vectorizer
- **Training Data**: 30 synthetic news articles (15 real, 15 fake)
- **Accuracy**: ~90%+ on training data

### Process Flow

```
User Input (News Article)
         ↓
Text Vectorization (TF-IDF)
         ↓
Logistic Regression Model
         ↓
Prediction (REAL/FAKE)
         ↓
Display with Confidence Score
```

## 🔧 Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Python Flask
- **ML Framework**: scikit-learn
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5
- **Data Processing**: pandas, numpy

## 📊 Model Training

The model is trained on synthetic data generated by `train_model.py`. To retrain the model:

1. **Delete the existing model files**
   ```bash
   del model.pkl vectorizer.pkl
   ```

2. **Run the training script**
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

The new model will be automatically saved and used by the Flask app.

## 🎨 UI/UX Highlights

- **Modern Design**: Gradient background with smooth animations
- **Responsive Layout**: Automatically adapts to screen size
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation support, dark mode support
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading states, smooth transitions
- **Mobile-Optimized**: Touch-friendly buttons and inputs
- **Bootstrap Integration**: Professional, polished appearance

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This application is for **educational purposes**. While it can identify certain patterns associated with fake news, **always verify important information with multiple reliable sources**. Machine learning models can make mistakes, and no model is 100% accurate.

For critical decisions, consult:
- Established news organizations
- Primary sources
- Fact-checking websites
- Domain experts

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **No Data Collection**: Your input is not stored or logged
- **Local Processing**: Everything runs locally on your machine
- **No Server Upload**: Articles are not sent to external servers

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Model files not found
- The app automatically generates them on first run
- Make sure you have write permissions in the project directory

### Port 5000 already in use
- Change the port in `app.py` line 85: `app.run(debug=True, host='localhost', port=5001)`

### Dependencies not installing
- Upgrade pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`
- Try installing with Python 3.8+: `python3 -m pip install flask scikit-learn pandas numpy`

### Predictions not working
- Make sure the text is at least 10 characters long
- Try with longer text for better accuracy
- Clear your browser cache and refresh the page

## 📈 Model Improvement Ideas

To improve the model:

1. **Use larger datasets** - Replace synthetic data with real fake news datasets
2. **Add more features** - Include source credibility, writing style analysis
3. **Ensemble methods** - Combine multiple ML models
4. **Deep learning** - Use neural networks for better pattern recognition
5. **Cross-validation** - Improve model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: What types of fake news can it detect?**  
A: It's trained to identify patterns in misleading claims, sensational language, and unverified information.

**Q: How accurate is the model?**  
A: ~90% accuracy on synthetic data, but real-world accuracy depends on article type and training data quality.

**Q: Can I use my own dataset?**  
A: Yes! Modify `train_model.py` to load your dataset instead of generating synthetic data.

**Q: Is the model updated automatically?**  
A: No, you need to manually retrain it. Delete the .pkl files and let the app regenerate them.

**Q: Can I deploy this online?**  
A: Yes! Use services like Heroku, PythonAnywhere, or AWS. However, the synthetic dataset may not perform well on real-world data.
